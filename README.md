An Engineering Project that classify images with using Deep Learning Algorithms.
Development steps:
• Data Collected from Twitter API and stored in MongoDB.
• Manual image labeling for each class. Developed a website to speed it up this process.
• Image Classification with TensorFlow.
• OCR Algorithms used to get texts from images that include text for data mining.
